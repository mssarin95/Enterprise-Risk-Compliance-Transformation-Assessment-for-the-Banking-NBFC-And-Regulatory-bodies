# Enterprise-Risk-Compliance-Transformation-Assessment-for-the-Banking-NBFC-And-Regulatory-bodies
A regulatory-driven assessment of enterprise risk and compliance practices in the Banking/NBFC sector, benchmarking RBI, SEBI, and Big 4 frameworks to identify gaps, strengthen governance, and improve regulatory readiness.
Project Overview

This project presents a consulting-style, regulatory-driven assessment of Enterprise Risk and Compliance Management practices in the Indian Banking and NBFC sector.

Using official regulatory documents (RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, Government of India), industry reports from Big 4 firms, and consulting frameworks, the project evaluates current risk management practices, identifies compliance gaps, and proposes a structured transformation roadmap to improve governance, regulatory readiness, and enterprise risk visibility.

The project focuses on analysis, reporting, visualization, and strategic recommendations, supported by Python-based data modeling and web scraping.

Business Problem

Banks and NBFCs in India face increasing regulatory scrutiny, rising operational and fraud risks, fragmented risk data, and manual compliance processes.

Key challenges include:
	•	Siloed risk and compliance information
	•	Manual regulatory reporting
	•	Delayed risk escalation
	•	Weak enterprise risk visibility
	•	Growing cyber and fraud threats
	•	Inconsistent governance practices

These issues reduce decision-making efficiency and increase regulatory exposure.

Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to:
	•	Map regulatory requirements (RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, Government of India)
	•	Identify enterprise risks (operational, fraud, cyber, compliance)
	•	Perform compliance gap analysis
	•	Benchmark against Big 4 / McKinsey frameworks
	•	Design a transformation roadmap
	•	Define KPIs and OKRs for measurable improvement
	•	Visualize risks using matrices, charts, and dashboards

Risk Matrix

Risks are scored using a 5×5 matrix
Risk Matrix (5x5)

Impact →
Probability ↓   1 (Low)   2        3        4        5 (High)
-----------------------------------------------------------
1 (Low)         Low      Low      Low      Medium   Medium
2               Low      Low      Medium   Medium   High
3               Low      Medium   Medium   High     High
4               Medium   Medium   High     High     Critical
5 (High)        Medium   High     High     Critical Critical

Risk Level Meaning:
	•	Low – Acceptable, monitor
	•	Medium – Needs attention
	•	High – Requires action
	•	Critical – Immediate action required
